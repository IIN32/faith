      'Ramadan',
      'Mandatory or Wajib/Fard fasting is the type of fasting that is prescribed by Allah ﷻ in the Quran '
      'and is obligatory for all able-bodied and mentally sound Muslims who have reached puberty.'
      'It is known as Sawm and is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.'
      '\nMuslims are required to fast during the month of Ramadan, which is the 9th month of the Islamic calendar.'
      'In Surat Al-Baqarah verset 185, \nAllah ﷻ instructs Muslims that:'
      '\nRamaḍân is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the '
      'standard to distinguish between right and wrong. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or '
      'on a journey, then let them fast an equal number of days after Ramaḍân. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that '
      'you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.',
      'General knowledge',
      'Fasting in Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.'
      'Since there are 12 lunar months superimposed over 12 solar months, Ramadan “moves back” about 11 days per solar year.'
      '\nIn 2024, the first day of fasting is expected to be March 11, though given differing interpretive schools among Muslim communities, '
      'some may declare the month to begin a day before or after the predicted date. \nLikewise, the holiday commemorating the end of fasting, '
      'most often called Eid al-Fitr, may fall on different days according to varying family, cultural, or interpretive preferences.'
      '\nThe Eid holiday that marks the end of fasting is expected around April 10 (dates may vary). '
      'It consists of a congregational prayer in the morning followed by visiting family and friends congratulating them and asking for forgiveness from everyone. The full day of Eid is a holiday, not just '
      'the morning prayers, and many will choose to take the day off. As such, it is an excused absence per the Academic Coursework and Religious Observance Policy. '
      'Others may prefer to return to school or work and take exams on Eid. In some cultures, the two days after Eid are also counted as part of the holiday.',
      'First 10 days/Ashra of Ramadan',
      '\n➼MERCY'
      '\n\nFirst ten days of Ramadan are the days of Mercy and blessing and every Muslim must seek the Mercy and Blessings of Almighty Allah'
      '\n\nDua for the first 10 days/Ashra is:'
      '\n\nوَقُل رَّبِّ اغْفِرْ وَارْحَمْ وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الرَّاحِمِينَ'
      '\n“O! My Lord forgives and have Mercy and You are the Best of Merciful” \n[Quran 23:118]'
      '\n\n➼BEST PRACTICES'
      '\n\n1.Make du’a at iftar time'
      '\n\nThe Prophet (saw) said, \n‘Whatever is prayed for at the time of breaking the fast is granted and never refused’. '
      '(Tirmidhi)When you sit down to iftar, take the time to seek Allah’s mercy and forgiveness before breaking your fast - '
      'we know you’re hungry, but this is the best time to do it! Make sure you supplicate using the names Ar-Rahman (the Most Compassionate) and Ar-Rahim (the Most Merciful).'
      '\n\n2. Make du’a for others to receive mercy'
      '\nYou should also pray for mercy and guidance for your loved ones during the first ten days - this will allow both you and them to benefit from the blessings of this time.'
      'The Messenger of Allah (saw) said, \n‘There is no Muslim servant who supplicates for his brother behind his back but that the angel says, \n“And for you the same”’. \n(Muslim)'
      '\n\n3. Keeping good relations with your family'
      '\nDuring the first ten days, take the time to visit or call family members who you don’t often speak to, and make sure you seek forgiveness from anyone you’ve had a falling out with. '
      'It is important for you to take the first step towards building bridges, as being close with your relatives will bring you closer to Allah.\nThe Messenger of Allah (saw) said, '
      '\n’The merciful are shown mercy by Ar-Rahman. Be merciful on the earth, and you will be shown mercy from Who is above the heavens. The womb is named after Ar-Rahman, '
      'so whoever connects it, Allah connects him, and whoever severs it, Allah severs him’. \n(Tirmidhi)'
      '\nThe womb is named after Ar-Rahman (the Most Compassionate), so we should be merciful and compassionate towards those connected to us through the womb i.e. our family and extended family. '
      'Show mercy towards your family, and Allah will show mercy towards you.'
      '\n\n4. Increase your dhikr'
      '\n\nThis is a really easy way to seek Allah’s mercy: after every Salah, recite \nTransliteration:\n‘Subhan-Allahi wa bi-hamdi-hi’ \n20 times (i.e. 100 times a day). \n\nReciting this simple dhikr will obliterate your sins, '
      'even if they are as much as the foam of the ocean. (Muslim)Dhikr in general is a good way to draw closer to Allah in Ramadan, as He says in the Noble Qur’an, \n‘So remember Me; I will remember you’. \n(The Noble Qur’an, 2:152)'
      '\n\n5.Night Prayers'
      '\n\nMany of us are exhausted by fasting during Ramadan, and it can be difficult to motivate ourselves to wake up at night to pray and worship. However, encouraging our family to worship at night is an'
      ' important part of seeking Allah’s mercy - and it can help us get motivated too!The Messenger of Allah (saw) said, \n′May Allah have mercy on a man who gets up at night and prays, then he wakes his wife '
      'and she prays, and if she refuses he sprinkles water in her face. And may Allah have mercy on a woman who gets up at night and prays, then she wakes her husband and prays, and if he refuses she sprinkles water in his face’.'
      ' \n(Sunan An-Nasa’i)\nSpread the mercy of Ramadan by encouraging others to worship at night!'
      '\n\n6. Recite these du’as for mercy'
      '\nHere are a few du’as you should be reciting to seek Allah’s mercy in the first 10 days:'
      '\n\n➥‘رَّبِّ اغْفِرْ وَارْحَمْ وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الرَّاحِمِينَ’'
      '\nTransliteration:\n"Rabbi ighfir warham wa anta khair-ur-raahimeen"\n\n’And [O Prophet] say, “My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful”’. \n(Qur’an, 23:118)'
      '\n\n➥‘اللّهُـمَّ إِنَّـي أَسْـأَلُـكَ بِرَحْمَـتِكَ الّتِي وَسِـعَتْ كُلَّ شيْء، أَنْ تَغْـفِرَ لي’\nTransliteration:\n"Allaahumma inni as’aluka bi-rahmatika al-lati wasi’at kulla shay’in an taghfira li"\n\n‘O Allah, I ask You by Your mercy which envelopes all things, that You forgive me’.'
      '\n\n➥‘اللَّهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِي وَارْحَمْنِي وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالرَّفِيقِ الأَعْلَى’\nTransliteration:\n"Allahuma ighfir li warhamni wa alhiqni bir-rafiq-il-a’laa"\n\nAisha (ra) said, ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah (saw) saying at his death, “O Allah, forgive me and have mercy on me, and join me with the Highest Company”’. \n(Tirmidhi)'
      '\n\n7. Show mercy to others'
      '\nWhile seeking Allah’s mercy, it is important to remember that the Messenger of Allah (saw) said, \n‘Whoever does not show mercy to the people, Allah will not show mercy to him’. \n(Tirmidhi)'
      '\nThis means that showing mercy to others is an essential part of seeking Allah’s mercy. Without it, you may miss out on the blessings of the first 10 days. Mercy can mean talking kindly to '
      'others, offering people your seat on the bus even when you’re fasting and, of course, giving Sadaqah to those in need out of the mercy of your heart.'
      '\nShowing mercy and love to children is particularly important, as it is from the Sunnah of the Prophet (saw). In the first 10 days, why not donate a Ramadan Food Parcel to feed refugee children or those living in poverty, or begin your orphan sponsorship to support orphans who need your help?',
      'Second 10 days/Ashra of Ramadan',
      '\n➼Forgiveness'
      '\n\nSecond ten days of Ramadan day 11th to day 20th consists of the Ashra of forgiveness. Muslims must seek the forgiveness of Allah Almighty and regret for all their mistakes.'
      '\n➼Dua for second 10 days/Ashra:'
      '\n\nأسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ رَبي مِنْ كُلِ ذَنبٍ وَأتُوبُ إلَيهِ'
      '\n“I ask forgiveness of my sins from Allah who is my Lord and I turn towards Him.”'
      '\n\n➼BEST PRACTICES'
      '\n\n1) One minute of tasbeeh'
      '\n\nSalma Umm Rafi’ said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach me some words, but not too much for me’.\n The Messenger of Allah (saw) said, \n’Say “Allah is the greatest” ten times. Allah Almighty will say, \n“This is for me”. Say “Glory be to Allah” ten times. \nAllah Almighty will say, '
      '\n“This is for me”. Say “O Allah, forgive me”. \nAllah will say, “I have done so”. If you say it ten times, Allah will say each time, “I have done so”’. \n[Tabarani]\nSalma (ra) asked for a dhikr that was simple and quick and could therefore be said at any time. '
      '\nSimply by saying "Allahu Akbar" ten times and "SubhanAllah" ten times, and then seeking Allah’s forgiveness, Allah will immediately promise to forgive you, saying ‘I have done so’ every time you ask for His forgiveness.'
      '\n\n2) Take advantage of Surah Mulk'
      '\nThe Prophet (saw) said, \n’There is a chapter in the Qur’an of thirty verses, which will intercede for its companion until he is forgiven: \nBlessed is He in whose Hand is the dominion (i.e. Surah Mulk)’. \n[Abu Dawud]'
      '\nIt is best to recite Surah Mulk (Surah 67) every day, as it will intercede for ‘its companion’ - as in, the one who is close to Surah Mulk and recites it constantly.'
      '\n\n3) Continuously extinguish your sins'
      '\nGiving charity is not only an excellent way to multiply your rewards while benefiting others, it also wipes away your sins:'
      '\nCharity is one of the swiftest good deeds, because it could be just smiling at people, simply saying a good word and, in this day and age, a quick online donation. A good way to extinguish your sins continuously '
      'is through Sadaqah Jariyah, for example planting an olive tree, sponsoring an orphan or building a water well.'
      '\n\n4) Forgive - and you will be forgiven'
      '\nThe Prophet (saw) said, \n’Be merciful to others and you will receive mercy. Forgive others and Allah will forgive you’. \n[Ahmad]\nDuring the second ten days, make sure you forgive anyone you’ve had a falling out with. '
      'If you are holding onto any anger, bitterness or pain, it will help neither you nor them - in fact, you could be missing out on Allah’s forgiveness because of it. Take the first step towards building bridges, as Allah forgives those who have a forgiving nature.'
      '\n\n5) Daily du’a - for others'
      '\nFollowing on from that point, don’t just pray for your own forgiveness - seek forgiveness for your loved ones as well!Abdullah ibn Sarjis (ra) reported, \n’I met the Prophet (saw) and I ate a meal of stew with him. \nI said, “I ask Allah to forgive you, O Prophet”. '
      '\nThe Prophet said, \n“Yes and for you as well”. \nThen the Prophet recited the verse, \n“Seek forgiveness for your sins and for the believing men and women as well” [47:19]’. \n[Muslim]\nSeeking forgiveness for others is therefore the Sunnah of the Prophet (saw). '
      '\nPlus, when you make du’a for others, an angel requests that Allah answers the same du’a for you.The Messenger of Allah (saw) said, \n“There is no Muslim servant who supplicates for his brother behind his back but that the angel says, “And for you the same”′. \n[Muslim]'
      '\n\n6) Daily iftar - for others'
      '\nAnother way that giving to others can be a way to seek forgiveness!The Messenger of Allah (saw) said, \n’Whoever provides iftar for a fasting person in it (Ramadan), then that shall be a forgiveness for his (minor) sins and freedom from the Fire’. \n[Ibn Khuzaimah]'
      '\nProviding iftar for a fasting person doesn’t necessarily mean cooking for them. It could be giving them a date or pouring them a glass of water. \nIt could also be giving iftar to a family elsewhere in the world, such as in the Rohingya refugee camps or in war-torn Yemen, or the needy in Palestine. '
      '\n\n7) Make Wudu as often as possible'
      '\nThe Messenger of Allah (saw) said, \n’A Muslim man does not perform ablution in an excellent manner and then performs prayer, but that Allah will forgive him for what occurred between his prayer and the next’. \n[Bukhari]\nTop tip: Increase your voluntary prayers throughout the day and make Wudu before all of them!'
      '\n\n8) Erase ALL your sins - in two minutes!'
      '\nJust like making Hajj to the Ka’bah, praying in Masjid Al-Aqsa carries the amazing blessing of having all your sins wiped out.'
      '\nOf course, the Prophet (saw) was aware that many of us would find it difficult to make this journey, which is why he prescribed for his Ummah an alternative; gifting light to Masjid Al-Aqsa.'
      '\nThe Prophet (saw) was asked, \n‘If one of us cannot visit it [Al-Aqsa], what should we do?’ He (saw) said, \n’Then he should make a gift of some oil to be lit therein [in its lamps]. '
      '\nFor indeed the one who gifts this to it, will be like the one who has prayed therein’. [Ahmad]By gifting light to Al-Aqsa during these blessed days, '
      'you will earn forgiveness for all of your sins, in sha Allah - just as you would on Hajj.'
      '\n\n9) Trust in Allah’s forgiveness'
      '\nThis Ramadan, as you seek Allah’s forgiveness, it is important to remember to trust Allah and hold on to hope. Whether you are making du’a, giving charity or praying at night, trust that Allah will forgive you and have faith in His infinite mercy:'
      '\nDon’t ever doubt in Allah’s forgiveness. In these second ten days, put all your effort into seeking His forgiveness with these simple worships, and trust that Allah will recognise your sincerity and repentance and erase all your sins. May Allah make us from those who are forgiven this Ramadan, ameen.',
      'Third 10 days/Ashra of Ramadan',
      '\n➼SAFETY'
      '\n\nThird Ashra starts on the 21st of Ramadan and ends 29th or 30th of Ramadan, according to the moon. Third Ashra is known as Safety from Hell (Nijat). Every Muslim must pray '
      'to be safe from Hellfire. The Last Ashra is very important and superior. In this Ashra, the Night of Power (Lailatul Qadar) also falls, and many Muslims also practice Aitkaf '
      '(seclusion for prayers) in this Ashra and try to maximize their prayers.'
      '\nAs stated in Quran:'
      '\n\n“We sent it (Quran) down on a blessed Night. Verily,We are ever warning. Therein (in that Night) is decreed every matter of ordainment. Amran (i.e. a command or this Quran '
      'or His Decree of every matter) from Us. Verily, We are ever sending (the Messenger) (As) a Mercy from your Lord.” \n[Quran 44: 3-6]'
      '\n➼Dua of third last 10 days/Ashra:'
      '\n\nﺍﻟﻠﻬﻢ ﺃﺟﺮﻧﺎ ﻣﻦ ﺍﻟﻨﺎﺭ'
      '\n"O Allah, save me from the fire of Hell"'
      '\n\n➼BEST PRACTICES'
      '\n\nThe last ten days of Ramadan hold great importance as it is when our Prophet (saw) devoted himself to worship. Another significance of the last ten days is the presence of the night of power (Laylatul Qadr) '
      'which is described in the Quran as, \n‘better than a thousand months’ (97:3). \nIt should be noted that the exact date of Laylatul Qadr is unknown, except that it is on an odd night in the last ten days, so we should make the most of every night. '
      '\nAbu Huraira reported that the Messenger (saw) said: ‘Whoever stands (in prayer) during Laylatul Qadr while nourishing his faith with self-evaluation and expecting reward from Allah, will have all of his previous sins forgiven’ \n(Bukhari). '
      '\n\n1.Perform i’tikaf'
      '\nMany people carry out i’tikaf, a spiritual retreat that requires total devotion to Allah (swt). It is normally performed in a mosque where there is little distraction. Time spent in i’tikaf is used worshiping, performing extra prayers, '
      'reciting Qur’an and making supplications. Even if you are unable to perform this ritual for the entire ten days, you can try a shorter length of time, such as one or two nights.'
      '\n\n2.Asking for forgiveness'
      '\nIt is narrated that Aisha (ra) asked the Messenger of Allah: \n‘O Messenger of Allah, if I know what night is the night of Qadr, what should I say during it?’ and he replied that you should say: \n‘O Allah, you are pardoning and you love to pardon, so pardon me.’ '
      '\nThis translates to: \n’Allahumma innaka ’afuwwun tuhibbul ’afwa fa’fu ‘annee’ (Ahmad).\n\nTherefore, it is recommended that we say this du’a as much as possible during the last ten days, as we do not know which of these days the night of power falls on.'
      '\n\n3.Keep remembering Allah'
      '\nIt’s easy to forget making some extra dhikr (supplications) after prayer. Now that it’s Ramadan an easy way to gain extra rewards is by making these supplications. \nUnfortunately, a lot of us find it difficult to make time because of work or school, '
      'but the most practical way to include these important supplications in our busy schedule is by utilizing wasted time. \nSo, instead of looking at your phone, reading the news or staring around while on the train, you can perform dhikr. '
      '\n\n4.Make a list of du’as'
      '\nWe often have so many goals or wishes we need Allah’s help with. \nWhat better time to make du’a than the last ten days of Ramadan? \nOne helpful way to ensure that you don’t forget to ask what you need is to make a list. '
      '\n\n5.Memorize a new surah'
      '\nTry memorizing a surah - even a small one - and read the English translation to attain benefits. Another way to reap more benefits is to teach the surah you’ve learned to a friend or a family member. '
      'This is because our Prophet (saw) said: \n‘The best among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Quran and teach it.’ \n(Narrated ’Uthman in Bukhari)'
      '\n\n6.Giving Sadaqah'
      '\nHas this ever happened to you? You make your list of goals for the last 10 nights and are determined not to miss anything. '
      '\nYou write down all the du’as so you don’t forget any, and set out how many pages of Qur’an you want to read every night. '
      'It means that when the last 10 nights arrive, you are ready and prepared.'
      '\nBut then, on one of the nights, maybe the 25th or the 27th or even the days after, you forget one essential good deed. You forget to give Sadaqah. '
      '\nThe Best 10 Nights is a tool that ensures you don’t miss giving on Laylat al-Qadr by automating your donations over the last 10 blessed nights of Ramadan. '
      '\nThis night carries the reward of worshipping for over 1000 months, so don’t miss the opportunity to maximize your rewards.'
      '\n\n7.Make a personal Dua list.'
      '\nAsk yourself what you really want from Allah. \nMake a list of each and everything, no matter how small or how big it is, whether it deals with this world or not. '
      '\nAllah loves to hear from us. Once this list is ready, you can do three things: '
      '\n➦- Ask Allah to give you those things '
      '\n➦- Think about what actions you have taken to get those things '
      '\n➦- Develop a work plan to get those things in future.'
      '\n\n8.Evaluate yourself.'
      '\nAsk yourself those questions that need to be asked. Do an evaluation of where you are and where you are going. '
      '\nLet this evaluation lead you to feel happiness for the good you have done and remorse for the bad you have done. '
      '\nThis latter feeling should make it easier to seek Allah`s sincere forgiveness when making the Dua mentioned in tip number one above.'
      '\n\n9.Make long, sincere and deep Duas'
      '\nAbu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, related that the Prophet said: '
      '\nWhen the last one-third of the night remains, our Lord, the Glorious One descends towards the heaven of the earth and proclaims: '
      '\nWho is that who supplicates for Me, and I grant his supplication? \nWho is that who begs Me for anything and I grant it to him? '
      '\nAnd who is that who seeks My forgiveness, and I forgive him? \n(Bukhari, Muslim).'
      '\nThat means for instance, waking up one hour before Suhoor time to ask Allah for anything and everything you want that is Halal. '
      '\nThis can be done using the Duas of the Sunnah, but also Dua in your own language, with sincerity and conviction.'
      '\n\n10.Memorize a different Dua every night'
      '\nThey don`t have to be long. \nThey can be just one line. And be sure to know what they mean generally at least, even if you don`t know the exact translation in English.\n'
      'You can put them on index cards (or and keep them with you during the day, glancing at them during work, while driving, waiting in line, etc.) \nThen practice them at night in prayer.'
      '\n\n11.Take the family to Tarawih'
      '\nHave your spouse and kids missed Tarawih most of Ramadan because you weren`t there to drive them to the Masjid, which is too far away to walk to? '
      '\nIf so, do all of yourselves a favour and bring everyone for Tarawih in these last ten nights.'
      '\n\n12.Finish reading a book on the Prophet'
      '\nRead about the Prophet`s life, which can increase your love for him and Islam by seeing how much he struggled for Allah`s sake. It may inspire you to push yourself even harder during these last ten nights. '
      '\nThis community is built on sacrifice.'
      '\n\n13.To do list for the Night of Power'
      '\nMake a to do checklist for each Night of Power. \nThis should define how you would like your night, the one better than a thousand months, to be used. \nPick things from this list and define the sequence you would like to do things in. '
      '\nThis will help you avoid wasting your time in unproductive chats which common in the festive atmosphere of Masjids at the Night of Power.'
      '\n\n14.Reflect on the meaning of the Quran.'
      '\nChoose the latest Surah or Surahs you`ve heard in Tarawih and read their translation and Tafseer. \nThen think deeply about their meaning and how it affects you on a personal level.'
      '\n\n15.Get your sins wiped out.'
      '\nAbu Huraira narrated that the Messenger said: \nWhoever stands (in prayer) in Laylatul Qadr while nourishing his faith with self-evaluation, expecting reward from Allah, will have all of his previous sins forgiven. \n[Bukhari and Muslim).'
      '\nDon`t just pray using the shorter Surahs that you know. \nTry to make your prayers longer, deeper and meaningful. \nIf you are familiar with longer Surahs, read the translation and explanation and then pray reciting these Surahs, '
      'carefully reflecting on the meaning while you pray.\nEven if you are only familiar with the shorter Surahs, read the translation and explanation beforehand, and then pray reflecting on the message of the Surahs.'
      '\nThis is a good way to develop the habit of concentration, even in regular prayers, where many of us tend to be fidgety and/or easily distracted.'
      '\n\n\nNB: Always do as much as you can do and do not over charge yourself. \nIt is more about the intention and faith we put into our acts of worship that count the most, so just make sure you do even if it is one, make sure you do it with faith and sincerity in the name of Allah.',

          'General Voluntary fasts.',
          '\nAlternate fasting'
          '\n\nAlso called the fasting of Prophet Dawood(R.A) in Islam'
          '\nIt is one of the best forms of voluntary fasting for those who are able to do that, as it says in the hadith:'
          '\nThe Prophet Mohammad (s.a.w) said:\n“The most beloved prayer to Allah is the prayer of Dawud (peace be upon him), and the most beloved fasting to Allah is the fasting of Dawud. '
          '\nHe used to sleep half the night, stand in prayer for one-third of the night, and sleep for one-sixth, and he used to fast alternate days.” \n(al-Bukhari, 1131; Muslim, 1159).'
          '\nHe was fasting one day and not fasting the next day, for example : fasting on Saturday rest on Sunday, fast on Monday rest on Tueday, fast on Wednesday rest on Thursday, '
          'fast on Friday, rest on Saturday fast on Sunday, rest on Monday, fast on Tuesday... and so on, one day fasting and the next day regularly eating and drinking.'
          '\n\nThe Muslim may observe a voluntary fast on any day of the year that he wishes, except those which are known to be forbidden, such as the two '
          '‘Eid days, on which fasting is haram, and Ayyam al-Tashriq (the three days following ‘Eid al-Adha),'
          'on which fasting is haram except on Hajj for those who do not have a hadiy (animal for sacrifice).'
          '\nEid al-Adha is the Feast of Sacrifice is the second and the largest of the two main holidays celebrated in Islam'
          '\nAlso excluded is deliberately singling out Friday for fasting, because it was reported that this is not allowed.'
          '\nIn order for this kind of fasting to be regarded as virtuous, it should not weaken a person and make him unable to do his primary duties, as it says in the hadith:'
          '\n“He used to fast alternate days, and he never ran away from battle (because he used to break his fast at times of jihad).” (al-Bukhari, 1977; Muslim, 1159)',
          'Specific voluntary fasts.',

          '\nThese are superior to general voluntary fasts: '
          '\n\nFasts which are specific to a type of person, such as young men who are not married, as mentioned in the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him):'
          '\n“We were young men with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and we did not have anything \n(i.e., we could not afford to get married).\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us,'
          '\n‘O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity.\nAnd whoever is not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.’” \n(al-Bukhari, 5066; Muslim, 1400)'
          '\nThis kind of fasting is more emphasized so long as a person is single, and this prescription is more emphatic the more provocation there is.\nThere is no mention of any specific number of days in this case. '
          '\n2-The second type is fasts prescribed at specific times,weekly,monthly and some annual.'
          '\n\nⓐ-The weekly fasts are on Monday and Thursday , days on which fasting is mustahabb\n(recommended, favoured or virtuous actions). \nIt was narrated that ‘Aishah said: '
          '“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was keen to fast on Mondays and Thursdays.'
          '\n” (al-Nasai, 2320; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, 4827).'
          '\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, and he said: '
          '\n“Those are two days on which people’s deeds are shown to the Lord of the Worlds, and I want my deeds to be shown to Him when I am fasting.'
          '\n” (Al-Nasai, 2358; Ibn Majah, 1740; Ahmad, 8161; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 1583). \nHe was asked about fasting on Mondays and he said, '
          '“On that day I was born and on that day revelation came to me.” (Muslim, 1162) '
          '\n\nⓑ-With regard to the monthly fasts, it is mustahabb to fast on three days of each month. \nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: '
          '\n“My close friend [i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] advised me to do three things which I will never give up until I die: \nfasting three days each month, '
          'praying Duha, and sleeping after praying Witr.” (al-Bukhari, 1178; Muslim, 721). \nIt is also mustahabb to observe this fast in the middle of the hijri month, on the days called Ayyam al-Bid . '
          '\nIt was narrated that Abu Dharr said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, ‘If you fast any part of the month then fast on the thirteenth, '
          'fourteenth and fifteenth.\n’” (al-Nasai, 2424; Ibn Majah, 1707; Ahmad, 210; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, 673)\nAnnual fasts are observed on specific days, '
         'or during periods when it is Sunnah to fast.',
         'Fasting Mondays and Thursdays',
         '\nMondays&Thursdays'
         '\n\nAishah(r.a) narrated that: \n"The Prophet used to try to fast on Mondays and Thursdays" \n[Tirmidhi, Nasai, and Ibn Majah].'
         '\nFasting twice a week is not only Sunnah, or tradition of the Prophet, but in fact is said to be a healthy routine for your body. '
         'There are studies that show that intermittent fasting is an opportunity for the body to cleanse itself of waste and to increase one`s metabolic rate, helping burn more calories.',
         'Thursdays and Fridays/Fridays and Saturdays',
         '\nFridays are the most blessed day of the week. \nRewards of good deeds are multiplied, however it is forbidden to fast voluntarily only on Fridays, but in combination with Thursday or Saturday.'
         '\nNarrated Abu Huraira: I heard the Prophet, peace be upon him, say: \n"None of you should fast on Friday unless he fasts a day before or after it" \n[Bukhari].',
         'Three Bright/White Days fasts',
         '\nOn the authority of ’Abdul-Malik ibn Qudamah ibn Milhan (ra) that his father (ra) said, \n’The Messenger of Allah (saw) used to command us to fast the (three) days with the bright nights (al-Ayyam al-Bid), the 13th, 14th and 15th [of every lunar month]’. \n[Nasa’i]'
         '\n\n➦The Three Bright Days'
         '\n\nAs mentioned before, the Messenger of Allah (saw) used to fast the 13th, 14th and 15th of every lunar month. In Arabic, these days are called Al-Ayyam al-Bid, which literally means ‘the white days’. \nThey are also called ‘the shining nights’, ‘the bright nights’ and ‘the bright days’. '
         '\nThe moon begins as a crescent, then waxes until it is full, then wanes until it is a crescent again. The three middle nights of the lunar month are when the moon is full and circular. \nThese are therefore the brightest nights of the month - hence the name! '
         '\nThe brightness of these nights is also one of the reasons the Prophet (saw) fasted on their days. \nIt was a way of giving thanks to Allah for lighting the dark nights. \nThis would have been particularly poignant at the time of the Prophet (saw) when electric lighting had not yet been invented.'
         '\n\n➦Reward of fasting the Bright Days'
         '\n\nOn the authority of Ibn ’Abbas (ra) who said, \n‘The Messenger of Allah (saw) didn’t use to break fasting on the Bright Days whether he was a resident or traveling’. \n[Nasa’i]'
         '\nSubhanAllah, the Prophet (saw) gave HUGE importance to fasting the bright days. \nEven though Muslims are exempt from obligatory fasting while travelling, he (saw) still made the effort to keep these voluntary fasts. '
         '\nOn the authority of ’Abdul-Malik (ra) who narrated from his father (ra) that the Messenger of Allah (saw) used to enjoin (fasting) these Three Bright Days, saying, \n‘They are (equivalent to) fasting the whole month’. \n[Nasa’i]'
         '\nAs reported by Abdullah Bin Amr Bin Al-As r.a. that the Messenger of Allah s.a.w. said: '
         '\n\nصَوْمُ ثَلاَثَةِ أَيَّامٍ صَوْمُ الدَّهْرِ كُلِّهِ'
         '\n\n“Observing fasting on three days of every month is equivalent to fasting the whole year”\n(Sahih Al-Bukhari)'
         '\n\nThe white days refer to the 13th, 14th, and 15th of the lunar calendar, so it may not be the same days each month of the solar Gregorian calendar. \nIt is not necessary to fast all three days. '

      'ASHURA',
      '\nEvening of Tue, Jul 16, 2024 – Wed, Jul 17, 2024'
      '\n\nSunnah in Islam is the body of traditional social and legal custom and practice of the Islamic community.'
      '\n\nThe day of `ASHURA which is the tenth(10th) of al-Muharram .'
      '\n\n➼History of Ashura'
      '\n\nAccording to a narration reported by Aishah r.a, the wife of the Prophet s.a.w, it was a pre-Islamic tradition of the Quraish'
      'and people of Makkah to fast on the 10th day of Muharram. \nThe Prophet s.a.w also observed it. \nHowever, when he migrated to Madinah,'
      ' the Prophet s.a.w found that a group of \n‘the People of the Book’ were also fasting on the same day. Rasulullah s.a.w asked them the '
      'reason why they were fasting on that day and they replied'
      '\n هذا يَوْمٌ عَظِيمٌ، وهو يَوْمٌ نَجَّى اللَّهُ فيه مُوسَى، وأَغْرَقَ آلَ فِرْعَوْنَ، فَصَامَ مُوسَى شُكْرًا لِلَّهِ'
      '\n"This is a blessed day. On this day, Allah saved (Prophet) Musa and drowned the people of Firaun (the pharoah), '
      'and so Prophet Musa a.s fasted on this day to give thanks to Allah.."(Sahih Al-Bukhari)\nUpon hearing their response, '
      'the Prophet s.a.w urged his companions to uphold this good act as Muslims believe in all the prophets of Allah a.s.'
      '\n\n➼Benefits of fasting on the day of Ashura:'
      '\nIn a Hadith narrated by Imam Muslim, the Prophet s.a.w said:'
      '\n\nأَفْضَلُ الصِّيامِ، بَعْدَ رَمَضانَ، شَهْرُ اللهِ المُحَرَّمُ'
      '\n"The best of fasts after the month of Ramadan is in the Month of Allah, which you call Muharram"'
      '\n(Sahih Muslim)'
      '\nOne of the greatest merits of fasting on the day of Ashura is that Allah s.w.t will expiate the sins from the previous year!'
      '\nIn a Hadith narrated by Imam Muslim, our beloved Prophet s.a.w made Dua to Allah to forgive the sins, committed in the previous'
       ' year, for all the people who fast on the day of Ashura.'
      '\n\nصِيامُ يومِ عاشُوراءَ، إِنِّي أحْتَسِبُ على اللهِ أنْ يُكَفِّرَ السنَةَ التِي قَبْلَهُ'
      '\n“Fasting on the Day of Ashura, I hope will expiate the sins of the previous year.”'
      '\n(Sahih Muslim)'
      '\n\n➼When is the fast of Ashura?'
      '\nThe fast of Ashura falls on the 10th day of Muharram. However, it is also encouraged for '
      'Muslims to fast a day before and after Ashura, i.e. 9th and 11th Muharram as well.'
      '\nThe Prophet s.a.w said in a hadith:'
      '\n\nصُومُوا قَبْلَهُ يَوْمًا، أَوْ بَعْدَهُ يَوْمًا'
      '\n"Fast on the day before and the day after Ashura.”'
      '(Musnad Ahmad)'
      '\n\nIbn Abbas r.a reported that Rasulullah s.a.w '
      'prioritised the fast on the day of Ashura over other days, besides the days in Ramadan, he said:'
      '\n\nما رَأَيْتُ النبيَّ صَلَّى اللهُ عليه وسلَّمَ يَتَحَرَّى صِيَامَ يَومٍ فَضَّلَهُ علَى غيرِهِ إلَّا هذا اليَومَ؛ يَومَ عَاشُورَاءَ، وهذا الشَّهْرَ. يَعْنِي شَهْرَ رَمَضَانَ'

      '\n“I have never seen Rasulullah s.a.w so eager to fast like he is for Ashura and prioritising it, besides Ramadan.”\n(Sahih Al-Bukhari)'
      '\n\nIt is Sunnah to fast the day before or the day after along with `Ashura, '
      '\nImam Ibn Al-Qayyim mentioned that there are three levels of fasting on Ashura, the first one being ‘the best’ and most complete, '
      'followed by the other degrees accordingly:'
      '\na-Fasting for 3 consecutive days on the 9, 10 & 11 Muharram.'
      '\nb-Fasting on 9 and 10 Muharram only.'
      '\nc-Fast on the 10th of Muharram only.',

      'ARAFAH/ARAFAT',
      '\n\nThe Day of Arafah'
      '\n 15th June 2024'
      '\n\nThe day of Arafat/Goodness falls on the 9th day of Zulhijjah, which is the 12th month in the annual Islamic Calendar,'
      ' based on the lunar cycle. \nAlthough it is part of the Hajj rituals, Muslims all over the world celebrate its significance. '
      'Its merit can also be achieved by Muslims who may not be able to perform Hajj on that particular year.'
      '\nOn the day of Arafah, any act of worship we do will result in more good rewards, so let’s increase our remembrance of Allah. '
      'We can do this at any time of the day, during virtually any activity. \nThe Prophet s.a.w said:'
      '\n\nما مِن أيَّامٍ أَعظَمَ عِندَ اللهِ، ولا أَحَبَّ إلَيهِ مِنَ العملِ فيهِنَّ مِن هذِه الأَيَّامِ العَشرِ؛ فأَكثِرُوا فيهِنَّ مِنَ التَّهليلِ، والتَّكبيرِ، والتَّحميدِ'
      '\n"There are no days greater in the sight of Allah and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, '
      'so during this time recite a great deal of Tahlil (La Ilaha Illallah), Takbir (Allahu Akbar) and Tahmid (Alhamdulilllah)."'
      '\n(Musnad Imam Ahmad)'
      '\n\nRemembering Allah brings about great benefits such as spiritual well-being, tranquillity and softening of the heart. Allah says: '
      '\n\nٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ ٱلْقُلُوبُ'
      '\n"Those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort.'
      '\n"(Surah Ar-Ra’d, 13:28)"'
      '\n\n➼Fasting on the Day of Arafah'
      '\nProphet s.a.w urged Muslims to increase their good deeds during the first ten days of Zulhijjah. Fasting is highly encouraged during the first nine days. '
      'On the tenth day of Zulhijjah, Hari Raya Aidiladha is celebrated.'
      '\nAllah has chosen the reward of fasting for Himself, as stated in the Hadith Qudsi: Allah says:'
      '\n\nكُلُّ عَمَلِ ابْنِ آدَمَ له إلَّا الصَّوْمَ، فإنَّه لِي وَأَنَا أَجْزِي بِهِ'
      '\n“All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except for fasting, it is for Me and I shall reward him for it.'
      '\n"(Al-Bukhari)'
      '\nFasting on the day of Arafah for non-pilgrims is a highly recommended Sunnah which entails a great reward; Allah forgives the sins of two years. '
      'It was narrated from Abu Qatadah r.a that the Messenger of Allah s.a.w was asked about fasting on the day of ‘Arafah and he replied:'
      '\n\nإِنِّي أحْتَسِبُ على اللهِ أنْ يُكَفِّرَ السنَةَ التي قَبلَهُ، والسنَةَ التي بَعدَهُ'
      '\n"It expiates for the past and coming years.\n”(Sahih Muslim)'
      '\n\nImam An-Nawawi mentioned in his book al-Majmu’, “With regard to the ruling on this matter, Imam As-Syafi’i and his companions said: '
      'It is mustahabb (sunnah) to fast on the day of Arafah for the one who is not in Arafah. As for the pilgrim who is present in Arafah, '
      'Imam As-Shafi’i and his companions said (in one of the prominent books of the Shafi’i legal school of thought) al-Mukhtasar, '
      '‘It is mustahabb (sunnah) for him not to fast.”'
      '\nProhibiting the pilgrims from fasting on these days is a great mercy for them, for fasting will exert undue hardship on the person performing the hajj. '
      'Above all, the Prophet s.a.w did not fast while he stood before Allah offering supplications in Arafah. On the other hand, those who are not performing their '
      'hajj may observe fasting to gain the merits of the blessed day.'
      '\n\nAnother useful tip to bear in mind while observing our act of worship is not to limit it to just ritual activities, but to educate ourselves on the significance '
      'of the action and its impact, both on a personal and communal level. Utilise this time to stay away from non-beneficial activities and focus on strengthening our relationship '
      'with Allah and with other human beings.'
      '\nOne of the most important things to do during these ten days is to repent sincerely to Allah and to give up all kinds of disobedience and sin. '
      'Repentance means coming back to Allah and foregoing all the deeds, open and secret, that He dislikes, out of regret for what has passed. '
      '\nRasullullah s.a.w mentioned in a Hadith Qudsi where Allah s.w.t would say to the angels:'
      '\n\n“My slaves have come to Me, looking dishevelled, from every deep valley hoping for My mercy, so if your sins were equivalent to the amount '
      'of sand or the drops of rain or like the foam on the sea I will forgive them. So go forth My slaves, having forgiveness and for what or who you have interceded for.”'
      '\n(narrated by Imam At-Tabrani)'
      '\n\n➼Supplication on the Day of Arafah'
      '\nIt is encouraged to devote ourselves to supplicating on the day of Arafah, seeking Allah’s help and guidance. Dedicate the supplication for ourselves, our parents, '
      'family, loved ones and community persistently, sincerely putting our full trust in Him. We should not feel disappointed or dejected if the answers to our supplications are '
      'delayed. Our Prophet s.a.w said:'
      '\n\nخَيْرُ الدُّعَاءِ دُعَاءُ يَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ وَخَيْرُ مَا قُلْتُ أَنَا وَالنَّبِيُّونَ مِنْ قَبْلِي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ'
      '\n"The best supplication is the one made on the Day of Arafah, and the best supplication of which I and the Prophets before me have made was, '
      '\n“There is no god but Allah, He is One, without partner, to Him belongs the dominion and all praises, and He is Omnipotent over all things"\n(At-Tirmizi)',
      'SHAWWAL',
      '\n\n➼What is Shawwal?'
      '\nBegins, April 10, 2024. Ends, May 8'
      '\n\nThe month of Shawwal is the month following the holy month of Ramadan and in it, there is the opportunity for great reward for worshippers as outlined by the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). '
      '\n\nMuslims have the opportunity to fast the six days of Shawwal, which are voluntary fasts that can be completed at any time throughout the month, before the end of Shawwal. The six days of Shawwal '
      'are recommended as a means of redeeming any shortcomings in the quality of our fasts in the month of Ramadan and are equivalent to a year of fasting if accepted by Allah (SWT).'
      '\n\nIt is Sunnah to fast six days of Shawwal, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \n“Whoever fasts Ramadan then fasts '
      'six days of Shawwal, it is as if he fasted for a lifetime.” \n(Muslim, 1164).'
      '\nScholars have explained that the reward of actions is multiplied at least tenfold. Based on the statement above, fasting in Ramadan for thirty days is equivalent to fasting for three hundred days, '
      'and the six days of Shawwal is akin to fasting for sixty days. Our beloved Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. himself stated this explicitly: '
      '\n\nصيامُ شَهرِ رَمَضانَ بِعَشرةِ أشهُرٍ، وسِتَّةُ أيَّامٍ بَعْدهُنَّ بِشَهرينِ، فذلك تمامُ سَنَةٍ'
      '\n“Fasting Ramadan is like fasting ten months, and fasting six days (of Shawwal) is like fasting for two months. That is like fasting a full year.”\n(Musnad Ahmad)'
      '\n\n➼Fasting consecutive days in Shawwal is recommended'
      '\nIt is encouraged for Muslims to fast the six days in Syawal consecutively as it provides greater reward and virtue in it. Based on the hadith narrated by Imam al-Tabarani and others, it is reported that the Prophet s.a.w. said:'
      '\n\nمَنْ صَامَ سِتَّةَ أَيَّامٍ بَعْدَ الْفِطْرِ كَانَ تَمَامَ السَّنَةِ'
      '\n“Fasting six consecutive days after Aidilfitri is like fasting the entire year.”'
      '\n\nHowever, if someone is unable to do so, it is still valid to fast gradually for as long as it is observed within the month of Shawwal.',
      'MUHARRAM',
      '\n\n➼What Is Muharram?'
      '\nStarts July 6th and ends on Monday, August 5th'
      '\n\nLiterally meaning ‘forbidden’, Muharram is one of the four sacred months (Dhul Hajj, Dhul Qa’dah, and Rajab). '
      '\nAccording to the Islamic teachings, the month of Muharram is so sacred that certain actions become forbidden during it, '
      'as they violate its sanctity. \nYou can better understand the significance of Muharram in Islam because both the House of Allah '
      '(Al Masjid Al Haram) and the month of Muharram-ul-Haram derive their names from the same Arabic root. \nBoth of them can be known '
      'as sacred spaces (or months) in which every deed- good or bad- weighs heavier on scales.\nThis automatically makes Muharram a special '
      'month simply because Allah (SWT) has chosen it to be. Allah (SWT) commands us to \n“not wrong ourselves” and have righteous behaviour and pure intentions in the holy month.'
      '\nAccording to Islamic history, Muharram is the month in which Allah (SWT) increased the reward for fasting, rescued the people of Prophet Musa (RA), and miraculously brought Prophet Nuh’s (RA) ark to rest. '
      '\n\n➼When Is Muharram'
      '\n\nBeing the first month of the Muslim Calendar or Hijri Calendar, Muharram marks the beginning of the Islamic year. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) referred to Muharram as '
      '“the Sacred Month of Allah (SWT).” This made Muharram the only month with which Allah’s (SWT) name has been attached to and thus a highly blessed month for the followers of Islam.  '
      'Every year Muslims worldwide wait for the Holy Month with the aim to pray and ask for forgiveness. According to the lunar predictions, next year, Muharram 2024 is expected to '
      'starts on the evening of Saturday, July 6th and ends at sundown on Monday, August 5th'
      '\n\n➼Virtues of Fasting During the Month of Muharram'
      '\n“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \n‘The best of fasting after Ramadan is fasting Allah’s month of Muharram.” \n(Sahih Muslim)'
      '\nAbu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported, “I asked the Prophet (PBUH): ‘Which Prayer is the best after the obligatory Prayers?’ He (PBUH) said: '
      '’Prayer during the mid of the night.’ I asked: ‘Which fasting is the best after that of Ramadan?’ He (PBUH) said, \n‘The month of Allah that you call Muharram’” \n(Sahih Muslim)'
      '\nBased on the Islamic culture and traditions, certain days of the year are considered more sacred as compared to others. One of them is the 10th Muharram, or commonly known as “The Day of Ashura.”',
      'SHA`BAN',
      '\n\n➼What is Sha`ban'
      '\nStart February 11, 2024 and ends on March 10, 2024.'
      '\n\nThe month of Shaban in Islamic calendar is the eight month that precedes the holy month of Ramadan. People widely celebrate the month for Shab-e-Barat or 15th of Shaban. Fasting during Shaban is recommended '
      'for those seeking forgiveness and praise Allah, the Almighty.\nIn this month, Muslims prepare for the prolonged fasting of Ramadan by eating nutritious food and praying for long hours. Shaban acts as a bridge '
      'between the sacred month of Rajab and the holy month of Ramadan. \nScholars narrate that Rajab is the month of planting, Shaban is for cultivation, and Ramadan is for harvesting. Therefore, good deeds and charity '
      'should be planned in Rajab, and performed in Shaban. The blessings of all kind deed is enjoyed in Ramadan.'
      '\nOur Prophet Muhammad s.a.w said:'
      '\n\nذَلِكَ شَهْرٌ يَغْفُلُ النَّاسُ عَنْهُ بَيْنَ رَجَبٍ وَرَمَضَانَ وَهُوَ شَهْرٌ تُرْفَعُ فِيهِ الْأَعْمَالُ إِلَى رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ فَأُحِبُّ أَنْ يُرْفَعَ عَمَلِي وَأَنَا صَائِم'
      '\n“It is a month where people tend to neglect, between the months of Rajab and Ramadan. It is a month in which the deeds are raised to the Lord of the worlds, and I like my deeds to be raised while I am fasting.”\n(Sunan An-Nasa’i)'
      '\nThe Prophet s.a.w. increased his acts of worship by fasting more compared to other months (other than Ramadan). '
      '\n\n➡As cited by Imam Al-Qastallani and Abu Dzar Al-Harawi, it is in the month of Sha`ban when verse 56 from Surah Al-Ahzab was revealed to the Prophet s.a.w. Scholars, therefore, '
      'have constantly reminded us to further increase in sending selawat (prayers) and salutations upon our Prophet s.a.w in light of the verse: '
      '\n\nإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ وَمَلاَئِكَـتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى ٱلنَّبِيِّ يٰأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ صَلُّواْ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُواْ تَسْلِيماً'
      '\nIndeed Allah and His angels bestow their prayers upon the Prophet. O you who believe, bestow prayers and peace upon him in abundance.\n(Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:56)'
      '\n\n➡In addition, Al-Imam Ibn Kathir in Al-Bidayah Wan-Nihayah, mentioned the majority of scholars are inclined to the view that the 15th of Sha`ban is also the date when the changing of the Qiblah (direction of prayer) took place. '
      '\nThe Qiblah for Muslims in the earlier period of the Prophet’s time was initially facing the Baitul-Maqdis, the holy city where Masjid Al-Aqsa is located until Allah s.w.t. later revealed to His beloved Prophet s.a.w about 2 months after the Hijrah:'
      '\n\nقَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ ۚ وَحَيْثُ مَا كُنتُمْ فَوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ شَطْرَهُ'
      '\n“ We have certainly seen the turning of your face, (O Muhammad), toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you (believers) are, turn your faces toward it (in prayer).”\n(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:144)'
      '\n\n➼Shaban fasting'
      '\nUpon the question from Usamah ibn Zaid related to increased fasting in the month of Shaban by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), Prophet Muhammad said:'
      '\n“That is a month to which people do not pay much attention, between Rajab and Ramadan. It is a month in which the deeds are taken up to the Lord of the worlds, and I like that my deeds be taken up when I am fasting.” \n(An-Nasa’i)'
      '\n\n➼Importance of 15th of Shaban'
      '\n\nThe 15th of Shaban or Shab-e-Barat is the night people use to seek forgiveness for the deceased. Shaban itself is a month in which good deeds are raised and brought in light to Allah, the all knowing. Therefore, praying for forgiveness and blessings paves the path to Jannah (Heaven). '
      'People can also fast on 15th of Shaban but it is not obligatory to fast on Shab-e-barat.'
      '\nAbū Mūsa al-Ash’arī says that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) told:\n“Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven on the night of the middle of Sha’bān and forgives the occupants of the Earth except for the one who associates partners with Allāh and one who harbors enmity.”'
      '\n\n➼Fasting on 15 Shaban'
      '\nOne cannot simply fast on 15th of Shaban for its religious significance. As, fasting on 15th of Shaban will lead to invention in the religion that is strictly forbidden in Islam. However, fasting on 13, 14, 15 Shaban can be done only if it falls on the days of fasting in a week allocated in Islam.'
      '\n\n➼Dua for Shaban month'
      '\nMuslims should recite the given dua for 1000 times in the month of Shaban:'
      '\n\nلاَ إِلٰهَ إِلاَّ ٱللَّهُ وَلاَ نَعْبُدُ إِلاَّ إِيَّاهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْمُشْرِكُون'
      '\n“There is no god save Allah. We do not worship save ‘He’ alone, making religion pure for Him (only) However, the disbelievers are averse.”'
      '\nFurther, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) asked people to conduct four units of rakats a day and recite Surah al Tawheed for 50 times after Surah Al Hamad. This will bestow easy death when the time comes for a Muslim.'
